			<h3>A Manifesto For Digital Adaptation</h3>
			<div class="illustration-right juggle">
				<span>One of the book's many illustrations by Veerle Pieters.</span>
			</div>
			<p>As web professionals we often find that the organisations we work for are more of a hinderance to digital success than a help.</p>
			<p>Company culture, operating procedures and business strategy are rooted in the past and have failed to adapt to the emerging digital economy. What worked in the past no longer does and your organisation needs to evolve.</p>
			<p>If your organisation is going to harness the full potential of the web, we believe it needs to make fundamental business changes.</p>
			<p>Specifically we believe that the following steps need to be taken.</p>

			<h3>Establish a Core Digital Team</h3>
			<p>Digital is not something that should just be outsourced to a third party and bolted on to an existing business model. It is a tool that should impact every part of the business from how we interact with customers to how we empower employees.</p>
			<p>For digital to become ubiquitous across a business it will need a digital team to facilitate that transformation. Although ultimately a transitory requirement, a digital team will help identify opportunities where digital can help and provide training and support to utilise its full potential.</p>

			<div class="illustration-left clouds-lines-dots">
				<span></span>
			</div>
			<h3>Establish Digital As An Independent Business Function</h3>
			<p>With the potential to support almost every aspect of most businesses, it makes little sense for digital to report into any one single department (such as marketing). It needs to be an independent business function in its own right, if it is going to equally support all areas of business. If the digital team reports into a single department like marketing then it is inevitable that digital will be seen purely as a marketing tool.</p>

			<h3>Empower Your Digital Team</h3>
			<p>Because of their technical skills, web professionals are often perceived as implementors. The vision, strategy and direction of digital are set elsewhere in the organisation.</p>
			<p>It should be the digital team that identifies how digital can help business functions and how it can support broader organisational objectives. That means they have the authority to shape the organisations digital presence. They have the knowledge of the medium and so should not be required to blindly implement the ideas of others within the company irrespective of their effectiveness.</p>

			<h2>The Book</h2>
			<h3>Digital Adaptation (Print Release: March 2014)</h3>
			<div class="illustration-right">
				<img src="" data-2x="" alt="" />
			</div>
			<p>Nothing is more frustrating than <strong>stubborn management</strong> entangled in dated workflows and inefficient processes. That's why we created <em>Digital Adaptation</em>, a new practical book on how to help senior management understand the Web and adapt the business, culture, team structure and workflows accordingly. No fluff, no theory &mdash; just techniques and strategies that worked in practice and showed results.</p>
			<p>The book will <strong>help traditional businesses and organizations to overcome their legacy</strong>, and help you plant the seeds of change with very little power. If you do want to finally see changes happening, this is the book to grab.</p>
			<p>Written by Paul Boag. Designed and illustrated by Veerle Pieters. 176 pages. The print release is scheduled for March 25th 2014, but the eBook is already available. <a href="https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/digital-adaptation-book.html">Get the book now.</a></p>
