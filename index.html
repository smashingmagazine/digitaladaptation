			<h3>A Manifesto For Digital Adaptation</h3>
			<div class="illustration-right juggle">
				<span>One of the book's many illustrations by Veerle Pieters.</span>
			</div>
			<p>As web professionals we often find that the organisations we work for are more of a hinderance to digital success than a help.</p>
			<p>Company culture, operating procedures and business strategy are rooted in the past and have failed to adapt to the emerging digital economy. What worked in the past no longer does and your organisation needs to evolve.</p>
			<p>If your organisation is going to harness the full potential of the web, we believe it needs to make fundamental business changes.</p>
			<p>Specifically we believe that the following steps need to be taken.</p>

			<h3>Establish a Core Digital Team</h3>
			<p>Digital is not something that should just be outsourced to a third party and bolted on to an existing business model. It is a tool that should impact every part of the business from how we interact with customers to how we empower employees.</p>
			<p>For digital to become ubiquitous across a business it will need a digital team to facilitate that transformation. Although ultimately a transitory requirement, a digital team will help identify opportunities where digital can help and provide training and support to utilise its full potential.</p>

			<div class="illustration-left clouds-lines-dots">
				<span></span>
			</div>
			<h3>Establish Digital As An Independent Business Function</h3>
			<p>With the potential to support almost every aspect of most businesses, it makes little sense for digital to report into any one single department (such as marketing). It needs to be an independent business function in its own right, if it is going to equally support all areas of business. If the digital team reports into a single department like marketing then it is inevitable that digital will be seen purely as a marketing tool.</p>

			<h3>Empower Your Digital Team</h3>
			<p>Because of their technical skills, web professionals are often perceived as implementors. The vision, strategy and direction of digital are set elsewhere in the organisation.</p>
			<p>It should be the digital team that identifies how digital can help business functions and how it can support broader organisational objectives. That means they have the authority to shape the organisations digital presence. They have the knowledge of the medium and so should not be required to blindly implement the ideas of others within the company irrespective of their effectiveness.</p>

						<td colspan="3">
							<p><span class="summary">Summary •</span> The foreword introduces the purpose of the book and explains why we decided to choose you as the audience for it. In fact, the book is written primarily for you as web professionals. A book you can quote to senior management and make real, lasting changes in your organization. Your job is to take the concepts covered in this book and put them in front of senior management.</p>

						<td colspan="3">
							<p><span class="summary">Summary •</span> The core problem with digital, faced by many large organizations, is that they were formed before the web as we know it today existed. Their systems, processes, and (in many cases) people are not configured to support it. In this chapter, Paul discusses warning signs of digital incompatibility in your company, organizational and cultural barriers and changes that the new digital landscape has brought. This is a chapter of how most organizations struggle with their digital strategy and what you have to know to avoid the problems in a long run.</p>

							<p><span class="summary">Summary •</span> As Richard Rumelt said, “good strategy works by focusing energy and resources on one or a very few pivotal objectives whose accomplishment will lead to a cascade of favorable outcomes.” In this chapter, you’ll learn how to select the right digital direction and how to deal with prioritization paralysis. Backed up by case studies and real-world examples, you’ll also learn how to form a digital strategy and how to use guiding principles, digital policies, and a responsibility matrix to complement the strategy. The chapter also explains how reorganizing teams and processes will help tackle dated, inefficient departmental structures.</p>

						<td colspan="3">
							<p><span class="summary">Summary •</span> Forming a digital strategy is one thing, but making it work requires changes in the digital culture. This chapter discusses main components of a digital culture, including collaboration, agile development, digital by default, innovation and service-oriented culture. The web can’t be neatly separated from the rest of organization; what’s necessary is a single organizational strategy that is heavily influenced by online. This chapter explains just how such a strategy can be established in practice.</p>

							<p><span class="summary">Summary •</span> There are various ways in which digital teams can be organised, but some approaches are more effective than others. This chapter discusses how to build an effective team and what role it should have, as well as how to find a good digital lead and attract and retain appropriate digital staff. Sometimes the digital team can feel like a Ping-Pong ball that ricochets around the organization—you are never quite sure where it will end up. This chapter explains the place, the position and the working environment of an effective digital team.</p>

							<p><span class="summary">Summary •</span> There is no shortage of big digital failures, from the London Olympics website to the Healthcare.gov website. The costs are staggering and the impacts devastating. The more complex and ambitious a digital project, the more traditional management approaches will struggle to scale. This chapter explores why digital projects fail and how you can minimize the risk of this happening by identifying and prioritizing user needs and involving the entire digital team in the conversation. Of course, this would work best within an iterative and collaborative context in which failure, prototyping and experimentation are deeply rooted within the digital culture.</p>

						<td colspan="3">
							<p><span class="summary">Summary •</span> Anybody can instigate change. As somebody working at the grassroots level of your organization’s digital strategy, you are a key catalyst of change. That work begins in your own team. You can plant the seeds of change by establishing good team-working relationships and atmosphere, enforcing good working practices, building bridges with colleagues and educating them, approaching management strategically, and being disruptive. If you don’t take action to change it, nobody else will. But if you do take action, there is a real opportunity to make your work more enjoyable and to have a real impact on your company.</p>
